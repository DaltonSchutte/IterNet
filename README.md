# IterNet
Working through the theory suggested that the techniques were not fundamentally different from a standard linear layer. Will revist if other ideas occur, but for now seems to be a dead end.

## To Do:
### Implement custom layer<br>
08/13/2019: Done, Iterative layer works but seems to have trouble learning<br>
<br>
### Develop testing regiment<br>
08/13/2019: Began determining set of parameters and configurations to test for paper<br>
<br>
### Theory research<br>
08/13/2019: Reading relevant works and conducting literature review<br>
<br>
### Begin write-up<br>
